# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Convolutional Neural Network

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee0db0aa-1c9c-496e-bfc2-20522c758d02)


This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. The model is built with TensorFlow and Keras, trained to classify handwritten digits (0-9). The CNN architecture includes multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by dense layers to output the digit predictions.

## Technology Used
### Backend:
- Python
- Flask
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pillow

### Frontend:
- NextJS
- TypeScript
- React
- TailwindCSS
- Shadcn/UI

## How to Use
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. Clone the repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/randyver/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
   ```
   
2. Set up backend
Navigate to the backend directory and install the required dependencies
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Running the model
Start the Flask server to serve the digit recognition model. Make sure not to quit the terminal
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Set up frontend
Open a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory, and install the required dependencies
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
5. Running the website
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
6. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 and the website is now running and ready to use!
